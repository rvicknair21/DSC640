Week 1 Assignment
You need to submit 3 bar charts, 3 stacked bar charts, 3 pie charts, and 3 donut charts using Tableau or PowerBI, Python and R using the data from the link below (the link will download a zipped folder containing three data files.) You may also use your own datasets if you wish. You can also submit using D3 if you choose â€“ but it is not required. You can choose which library to use in Python or R, documentation is provided to help you decide and as you start to play around in the libraries, you will decide which you prefer.
